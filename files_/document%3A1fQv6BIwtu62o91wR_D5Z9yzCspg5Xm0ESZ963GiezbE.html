DHS handles deaths/births however. So Planning Commission is best suited for now to say something about demographics. They have a demographer but need more capacity.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>They produce a strategic vision for the city, but they don&rsquo;t control other depts or their budgets. So they need to work with other depts to get them on board with the strategic vision.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>For the 2035 work, they worked with the </span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="http://citizensplanninginstitute.org/">Phila Citizens Planning Institute </a></span><span>and </span><span class="c6"><a class="c10" href="http://zoningmatters.org/">Zoning Matters.</a></span><span>&nbsp;They had 4-5 citizen planning meetings in spring and 4-5 in fall. These cost money, involve logistics.

Philadelphia just passed a new zoning code in Dec 2011. This process was kicked off in 2007, when 80% of citizens voted in favor of reforming the zoning code. The new code&rsquo;s major changes:</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><ol class="c12" start="1"><li class="c4 c0"><span>Make the zoning code more user-friendly</span></li><li class="c4 c0"><span>Simplify number of zoning classifications (from 60-ish to 40ish)</span></li><li class="c4 c0"><span>Establish the role of citizens in the zoning approval process.</span></li></ol><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>(Don&rsquo;t know how these are related) The Planning Commission just completed Philadelphia2035, a comprehensive plan. Now they&rsquo;re creating District Plans which rezone the city block by block. There are 18 districts and drafts for the first 2 were just released last Wed, open to public comment by email.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Currently citizen feedback is captured from public meetings. From Mark re public meetings: </span><span class="c8">To hold just one public meeting in a neighborhood with 100-person capacity, the rental fees range from $400 - $700</span><span>. If we want to do an adequate job of recording citizen&#39;s comments, a dozen Planners are required to facilitate discussions, record notes, and manage the entire event. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">The eight public meetings that were held around the city for the preparation of Philadelphia2035, our new comprehensive plan, cost approximately $6,000. This was paid for by a grant, as the operational funds were lacking. &nbsp;Eight meetings just scratched the surface! </span><span>&nbsp;Since nearly 100% of our work is location-based, if there were an on-line tool to illustrate the location of projects and allow citizens to comment on the natural or perceived benefits (proximity subway lines, &nbsp;bus transit, parks, schools etc.), City Planning could augment and enhance the effectiveness of out reach and elicit more community participation in important decisions. </span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">From Mark (email forwarded to philadelphia@ 1/13:</span></p><p class="c0"><span>I do have a project I would very much like for your team to consider - &nbsp;a community engagement/crowd-sourcing web application. &nbsp;Attached you will find a project proposal that I submitted to the City&#39;s Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT) late last year. &nbsp;City Planning doesn&#39;t have all of the funds or resources to see the phases of the project through to completion, so as it is described OIT can only help use with phase 1 (of 4) components. &nbsp;Seeing the idea to completion is where Code For America might help. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The idea is that the public could provide feedback on a proposed project &nbsp;on a web site that would record not just comments, but user-defined changes to a map. For example, City Planning is about to engage a very controversial project of consolidating facilities: &nbsp;rec centers, libraries, health centers, etc. &nbsp;In some districts of the City more of these facilities are needed, but others there is an over supply. &nbsp;Public feedback on proposed changes is important, but holding more than a small number of community meetings is cost prohibitive.</span></p><p class="c0"><span>If there was a web app that would allow users to:</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>a) click and drag a facility to a location on the map of their choice;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>b) add a graphic to represent a barrier to use of a facility like dangerous intersection or high-crime street;</span></p><p class="c0"><span>c) record comments linked to a geographic location; and</span></p><p class="c0"><span>d) save all the map and comments to a relational database for recall and analysis...</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>...then City Planning, or any other agency/department in Philadelphia city government, would have a powerful, reliable citizen engagement tool. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>As you may have been told, budgets are tight in Philadelphia. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">To hold just one public meeting in a neighborhood with 100-person capacity, the rental fees range from $400 - $700</span><span>.
