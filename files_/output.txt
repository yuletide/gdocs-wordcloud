Mark Wheeler & Clint Randall - City Planning - 2/4/12 Attendees:Mark WheelerClint RandallAdam Conner (GIS)Stuart AlterTo-DosMove forward with piloting the SMS/MMS idea. The SMS/MMS pilot should operate alongside the group’s traditional methods for capturing citizen input (ie, if the SMS/MMS pilot fails, they still need citizen input on these questions via trad methods).Clint/Mark will send over 3-5 questions they want to test. CfA will design/storyboard the test (including inputs and outputs). And we’ll go from there.Alex will follow up with Adam on the new mapping project between OIT and City Planning.CfA will have a followup meeting with Stuart about the 311 app that hasn’t launched yet to see how we can help them get it launched.SummaryCitizen feedback is needed for city planning projects.It’s too expensive to do meetings all around the city. And not enough people can attend them to make them cost effective.They need a more efficient and less expensive way to collect feedback.Clint also wants to expose city planning maps to more people. So some of his motivation is just getting the maps online.Interview NotesPlanning Commission is not associated with mayor’s office, so they continue to exist as mayors come and go.There is no one in the city responsible for demographics. DHS handles deaths/births however. So Planning Commission is best suited for now to say something about demographics. They have a demographer but need more capacity.They produce a strategic vision for the city, but they don’t control other depts or their budgets. So they need to work with other depts to get them on board with the strategic vision.For the 2035 work, they worked with the Phila Citizens Planning Institute and Zoning Matters. They had 4-5 citizen planning meetings in spring and 4-5 in fall. These cost money, involve logistics. Prefer other/different ways to engage more people.The map citizens worked with became a tool for grievances, rather than a tool for planning. Eg rather than putting a park on the map, citizens would point to problem areas and complain.L&I, Planning, Police, and Streets and Water have APIs ?[a]Donna J. Carney runs the PCPI (contact her). Citizens take a series of classes and are given a “Citizen Planner” certification when they finish. “As our resources and number of ‘graduates’ grow, the Institute is envisioned to act as a networking hub through which civic groups can share information and best practices”Zoning Matters is the official website of the Phila Zoning Code Commission, which is charged with developing a new zoning code that:is easy to understandimproves the City’s planning processpromotes positive developmentpreserves the character of Philadelphia’s neighborhoodsPossible opportunities for collecting citizen feedback are the computing centers around the city.

Mark Wheeler, GISP City Planner, City of PhiladelphiaClint introduced Mark to us -- he’s the one who wrote the blurb below.2. Clint Randall, Healthy Communities Coordinator, City of Philadelphia (joint grant between City Planning and Public Health)http://growninthecity.com/2011/03/5-questions-with-clint-randall-planning-for-healthier-communities-in-philadelphia/Clint is a friend through a couple different connections, so he explained planning and zoning in Philadelphia to me over drinks in December. As the first person “inside” city government I met, he made me really optimistic about finding good folks in Philly city government to collaborate with.3. Stuart Alter, Senior Program Manager, OITRecent promotion. New title TBD.4. Adam Cooper (?) from GIS dept. confirm last nameOutline:Intros & mention we have read email and project proposalRelationship between zoning code & a comprehensive plan (Philadelphia2035)?What is a district plan?Can you describe/show current feedback processes and give some examples of useful citizen feedback? What about less useful feedback?Plans for district plans?Technology complementing vs. instantly replacing current system. Show Tropo & Print & Share.Phila2035.gov looks like a WP site -- your experiences with WP for official city site?Background:Zoning sounded pretty boring to me before I started digging in, but nearly every small business owner I’ve talked to has a story to tell about zoning, licensing, and inspection. Philadelphia just passed a new zoning code in Dec 2011. This process was kicked off in 2007, when 80% of citizens voted in favor of reforming the zoning code. The new code’s major changes:Make the zoning code more user-friendlySimplify number of zoning classifications (from 60-ish to 40ish)Establish the role of citizens in the zoning approval process.(Don’t know how these are related) The Planning Commission just completed Philadelphia2035, a comprehensive plan. Now they’re creating District Plans which rezone the city block by block. There are 18 districts and drafts for the first 2 were just released last Wed, open to public comment by email.Currently citizen feedback is captured from public meetings. From Mark re public meetings: To hold just one public meeting in a neighborhood with 100-person capacity, the rental fees range from $400 - $700. If we want to do an adequate job of recording citizen's comments, a dozen Planners are required to facilitate discussions, record notes, and manage the entire event.  The eight public meetings that were held around the city for the preparation of Philadelphia2035, our new comprehensive plan, cost approximately $6,000. This was paid for by a grant, as the operational funds were lacking.  Eight meetings just scratched the surface!  Since nearly 100% of our work is location-based, if there were an on-line tool to illustrate the location of projects and allow citizens to comment on the natural or perceived benefits (proximity subway lines,  bus transit, parks, schools etc.), City Planning could augment and enhance the effectiveness of out reach and elicit more community participation in important decisions. From Mark (email forwarded to philadelphia@ 1/13:I do have a project I would very much like for your team to consider -  a community engagement/crowd-sourcing web application.  Attached you will find a project proposal that I submitted to the City's Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT) late last year.  City Planning doesn't have all of the funds or resources to see the phases of the project through to completion, so as it is described OIT can only help use with phase 1 (of 4) components.  Seeing the idea to completion is where Code For America might help.  The idea is that the public could provide feedback on a proposed project  on a web site that would record not just comments, but user-defined changes to a map. For example, City Planning is about to engage a very controversial project of consolidating facilities:  rec centers, libraries, health centers, etc.  In some districts of the City more of these facilities are needed, but others there is an over supply.  Public feedback on proposed changes is important, but holding more than a small number of community meetings is cost prohibitive.If there was a web app that would allow users to:a) click and drag a facility to a location on the map of their choice;b) add a graphic to represent a barrier to use of a facility like dangerous intersection or high-crime street;c) record comments linked to a geographic location; andd) save all the map and comments to a relational database for recall and analysis......then City Planning, or any other agency/department in Philadelphia city government, would have a powerful, reliable citizen engagement tool.  As you may have been told, budgets are tight in Philadelphia.  To hold just one public meeting in a neighborhood with 100-person capacity, the rental fees range from $400 - $700. If we want to do an adequate job of recording citizen's comments, a dozen Planners are required to facilitate discussions, record notes, and manage the entire event.  The eight public meetings that were held around the city for the preparation of Philadelphia2035, our new comprehensive plan, cost approximately $6,000.

Since 1950, the city has lost 25% of its residents, some of whom simply abandoned their property. Almost 70% of that vacant property is privately owned, and more than half those owners are delinquent on their taxes.Abandoned buildings and empty lots drag down the value of surrounding homes and businesses. According to Gillen, no part of Philadelphia is immune to this problem. Hard hit areas: Grays Ferry, Mantua, North Philadelphia and Pt. BreezeThe city acquires vacant property when it can but is unable to sell it quickly enough to improve overall conditions; there is not enough "churn,"New approach under Nutter:Embracing the market and treating land as if it has value. "This is a new concept in Philly. We’ve just been giving away land for too long," she said.This new approach includes shortening the paperwork necessary to acquire vacant property; creating a strategy for developing that land; maintaining vacant land in the short term; and listing all the vacant property available on a new Web site www.phila.gov/rda.Other Cities: Flint, MI (Daniel Kildee, treasurer of Genesee County, Michigan)Initial approach: collecting delinquent taxes and let vacant property languish in a bureaucratic muddle.  At sheriff’s sales, the city practically gave away property that should have been a valuable asset to the people.New solution: they established the Michigan Land Bank, a public authority that deals with tax delinquency and seeks productive uses for vacant property. new system is “transparent, efficient and predictable.”Reduced wait from 7 to 2 years to acquire vacant propertyA single abandoned building is virtually worthless to the city, but the land bank accumulates batches of vacant property, enabling Flint to enter the marketplace with more leverage, command a greater price for its land, and exert greater influence over how that property is developed.Philadelphia is currently exploring whether the land bank model can be successfully transferred here.Mt. Airy USA (Farah Jimenez)In the 1990s, Mt. Airy’s commercial corridor, Germantown Avenue, suffered because of nearby blight. Abandoned property reduced the value of surrounding homes and created cover for criminal activity.The success of Phebe Commons, a retail and office complex located at 6700 Germantown Avenue, shows how a neighborhood can turn itself around.Eventually, Mt. Airy USA acquired the property, but it was not easy. "Vacant land owners know you’ll pay a premium to get them out of Dodge," Jimenez remarked.Over the next two years, the nonprofit worked diligently to acquire surrounding lots, some owned by the city. The process moved slowly, but Jimenez’s patience paid off: a credit union, an insurance company and a post office branch now occupy the space.The Vacant Land Issue (July 2011)http://www.citypaper.net/cover_story/2011-07-21-the-vacant-land-issue.html?c=rIn the '60s and '70s, vacancy began to take hold of Philadelphia and other big, industrial American cities like an infection, spreading house by house, and block by block. As one city source put it to City Paper, "crazy things started to happen." And as properties went up for auction for one reason or another, the city came to own more and more of that craziness itself as inventory.Administration after administration tried to fix the problem. Mayor Ed Rendell courted development but avoided comprehensive and wide-ranging policies. (as former housing director John Kromer points out in his several books on the city's struggle with blight) Mayor John Streetembarked on a boldly wide-ranging plan called the Neighborhood Transformation Initiative, to demolish, acquire and assemble lots for redevelopment. But the last two steps proved more difficult than the first — because city-owned vacant parcels are actually owned by more than a half-dozen agencies, each with its own rules and complications, and because of political infighting and a perception of favoritism.Enter Mayor Michael Nutter:Shortly after he took office, Nutter ordered that the conveyance of land for free or nominal fees be more or less haltedshutting down a process to which City Council members had enviable accessall such land deals required (and still do) the signature of the District councilperson, a practice known to (and hated by) many as "councilmanic prerogative." Land was valuable again, and there would be no easy doling away of it until the Nutter administration could come up with a comprehensive, fair, intelligible and sustainable plan for vacant land everywhere in the city.Despite a flurry of activity earlier this year by the mayor's appointed Vacant Land Task Force — and developments like the first-ever online catalog of Redevelopment Authority-owned property, as well as new systems for pursuing owners of blighted lots — no such comprehensive policy has emerged.Reasons: Debates within the administration, and between it and Councilinclude whether and when to charge "fair-market" value for vacant land what that even means in neighborhoods where the market is weak or nonexistent; under what circumstances to give away or lease smaller plots for side lots and gardens; when to demand that developers give back city land they haven't redeveloped; how and within what agency to create a "front door" for regular people to try and acquire vacant land.

Just as a smartphone app. Customizing it further would mean developing business process for how to deal with each button - where each button report is sent, what gets done with the request, and how to followup with the userPersonal note: The fact that they released this as a Beta crime reporting app seems problematic to me. Unless you read the copy on the app page, you don’t know that the app does NOT report anything to anyone. Seems unsafe to put this app out there, and expect people to read the disclaimer, esp after it’s been reported in lots of newspaper and sites as a working crime fighting tool.NotesFounder of uknowkids.com - tools for parents to keep kids safe onlineHe wants to donate the app to cities. Basic app would include functionality to send all requests to the same email, eg phillypolice@phila.gov. Then the email recipient would need to forward to appropriate people.Customers could get some customizations for “small cost.” Eg putting in the Philly Police logo and changing colors. Also could get some reporting. But still would send all requests to the same email.More advanced implementation would cost “no more than 10k” possibly as low as 5k. This version would include work to integrate Crimepush directly into a city’s 911 (or other) system.See CrimePush docs here.To test the email request, log into this after using app to report a crime.uname: crimepush@gmail.compwd: safekidsHere’s what the email looks like:BackgroundErica Atwood introduced us to them - she knows someone who is a cousin of one of the founders.For phone call:Get some background on who they areLearn where they’re at in developmentDoes the app connect to real police depts right now?What’s the plan for integrating it, if it doesn’t exist now?What’s the business model?Learn more about their future plans and how they see themselves working with local governmentsAnd how they see the application evolvingFrom the website:From iTunes app store - highlighted areas seem problematic:CrimePush: Building safer communities at the push of a button.

Best to not rely on this method. Relying on unpaid goodwill from developers will only last for so long before enthusiasm dies out, best not to rely on this. Motivation: Well-intentioned coders will only last so long. To maintain the instance requires payment or “a masochistic streak”. Common problem in open source (and other) projects, a la “a theater” is maintenance. Building it is not the hard part.Idea: Each city pays into a fund, LP acts as PM to coordinate features across cities (hosting is worked out on a city-by-city basis). Trade money for expertise & coding. Funding would be around 10-15k per city as part of a consortium, depending on how many cities pay in.Idea: Ad-space in the sidebar from local partners in exchange for dev and hosting and promotionIdea: Get an academic institution to become the technical sponsor. Discussed option of having Drexel co-op students take it over. They would manage it for 6-months, then pass it off to the next set of co-op students, and so on. CfA would serve as ongoing mentor/guidance.To set this up, CfA would work to establish a set of best practices that we’d “train” the next set of co-op students on (starting in April). Then serve as remote guidance.Ideas for “training”:Use Karl’s book to educate co-ops on open source processMake sure there’s a public bug-tracker filled with all of Philly’s concerns (we can work with Jeff to do this now)Github is good for now, can always be migrated/forked if things get weird“pre-emptive forking is a sign of bad faith”Contact Brigade about:ad-hoc guidanceprocess helpActionable items:Meet with Youngmoo next weekWork on bugs with JeffFunding for this: Knight ?  - Bring up with Donna re: funding===How big of a bite does LP want to take?LP got ~30k for dev + hosting etcIs CBU any good?Yeah, but needs more workFunding is needed for usage improvements/maintenance CfA Philly Projects List (Quick & Long Wins) IN no orderArtist CensusCultural Assets DBPublic Art APIPlannin Participation App (w/ Sophia Tu - IBM Smarter Cities (About Lisa Nutter) “So, when Nutter and others began developing the Digital On-Ramps program, she pressed for integrating the diverse elements of the education and training system.

Another is a system of certifications that demonstrate a participants competencies to prospective employers.”DOR:  “The strategy is to implement DOR in discrete, attainable and strategic pieces that can be built upon over time.

Cities United - Notes on Docs Cities United InitiativeDocs from Erica AtwoodNotesCities United: Building Communities to Reduce Deaths Among Black Men and BoysHomicide = leading cause of death for AA males aged 15 to 24. Children exposed to this violence suffer, along with the community at large, due to the decrease in the number of AA men remaining in the community49% of all homicide victims in 2005 were blackEstimated that 10mm children/year may witness or become victims of violence in their homes“When communities produce better boys, they produce better men.”The Open Society Foundation’s Campaign for Black Male Achievement presentsa particular opportunity to bring focus to these efforts, to help spread this focusnationwide, and to generate a national call to action. A collaboration between theOpen Society Foundation, the Knight Foundation, Casey Family Programs, theNational League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and otherorganizations such as national faith, community, civic, other governmental andmunicipal agencies, and fraternal organizations, and youth voices) could help tobegin and sustain the necessary conversations that would lead to specific citiesdeveloping action strategies in their respective locales.Objectives:Raise awareness of the issueKeep crisis at center of municipal conversationCreate national attentionDesired outcome is a reduction in the number of violence related deaths of AA males in the identified geographic areasApproach:Strategy group - mayors, ministers, foundations, youth from tipping point citiesAgenda needs to include key considerations like a) expanding the focus to achievement by men of color (including those on Native American reservations)b) understanding the intersections of youth education and familiesc) understanding different forms of partnershipsd) learning about best practices and lifting up what workse) measuring what worksf) providing leadership development and opportunities for mayoral mentoringg) understanding how to sustain these efforts.Hold a series of convening’s designed to help mayors transform the conditions of communities and reverse the trend where African American male presence is being depleted.Purpose is to assist cities in developing concrete action plans to align with existing efforts, to initiate new efforts, and to encourage a national call to action.In addition to raising awareness and receiving technical assistance utilizing the toolkit that the National League of Cities is developing, a set of recommendations would be developed designed to:a) Encourage the inclusion of a focus on African American males in existing initiatives where one does not exist.b) Establish new foci in additional cities/communities.c) Frame the role and deliverables for a Presidential Commission or Workgroup.See the report for an impressive list of current efforts underway. (CitiesUnited.pdf)Cities United: Building Communities to Reduce Deaths Among Black Men and Boys (Mayor’s Office)From meeting 10/25/2011 in Philly at the Natl Constitution Center.Meeting goals were to:Develop a shared sense of urgency to reduce violent related deaths among black malesUnderstand promising practices and opportunities for municipal leadership to reduce violent related deaths Identify strategies for integrating authentic youth voice and leadership in any initiative focused on reducing violent deaths among black malesDetermine next steps for developing a national agenda for reducing violent related deaths among black malesHow do we begin the natl conversation:Name the Challenge: Identifying obstacles and opportunities to serving black males in violence prevention effortsUnpack the Reality: Increasing understanding around the reasons for violent deaths, and how that disproportionately happens for black malesCreate Urgency: Developing a call to action for the need to address this issue with immediacyDispel Myths: Providing information to change the perception of black males who are victims of violent-related deathsUnderstand and Implement What Works: Increasing knowledge about effective approaches currently being usedOther questions:What are your best practices in addressing violence?What innovative solutions exist in your cities?Who will be your point of contact for continued collaboration?See the presentation. (CitiesUnited_BCSMPresentation)Black Victims of Violent Crime (Bureau of Labor Statistics)From 2001 to 2005:Black males were more vulnerable to violent victimization than black females.Younger blacks were generally more likely than older blacks to be victims of violence.Blacks who had never married were more likely than all other blacks to be victims of violence.Blacks in households with lower annual incomes were at a greater risk of violence than those in households with higher annual incomes.Blacks living in urban areas were more likely than those in suburban or rural areas to be victims of violence.See the report for a lot of stats. (CitiesUnited_BlackVictimsViolentCrime.pdf)Youth Violence (CDC)Report is from 2010In 2007, 5,764 young people ages 10 to 24 were murdered—an average of 16 each day (CDC 2010a). Homicide was the 2nd leading cause of death for young people ages 10 to 24 years old (CDC 2010a).Among 10 to 24 year-olds, 86% (4,973) of homicide victims were male and 14% (791) were female (CDC 2010a). Among homicide victims ages 10 to 24 years-old, 84% were killed with a firearm (CDC 2010a).See the report for more stats, not all violence related. (CitiesUnited_CDCYouthViolence.pdf)Children’s Exposure to Violence: A Comprehensive National Survey (Juvenile Justice Bulletin)Report is from data gathered Jan-May 2008This survey is the first comprehensive attempt to measure children’s exposure to violence in the home, school, and community across all age groups from birth to age 17, The survey confirms that most of our society’s children are exposed to violence in their daily lives. More than 60 percent of the children surveyed were exposed to violence within the past year, either directly or indirectly. Nearly one-half of the children and adolescents surveyed were assaulted at least once in the past year, and more than 1 in 10 (10.2 percent) were injured in an assault; 1 in 4 were victims of robbery, vandalism, or theft; 1 in 10 suffered from child maltreatment (including physical and emotional abuse, neglect, or a family abduction)1 in 16 were victimized sexually.More than 1 in 4 witnessed a violent actNearly 1 in 10 saw one family member assault another. Multiple victimizations were common. Nearly seven in eight children who reported being exposed to violence during their lifetimes also reported being exposed to violence within the past year, which indicated that these children were at ongoing risk of violent victimization.

Must be organized across depts to succeed.BackgroundTechnically philly coverage: http://technicallyphilly.com/people/andrew-bussBus on FRP: “The interesting thing that we’ve done with this and the city has done well is to build an external base of stakeholders or partners, so when we wrote the grant, it was written in conjunction with the Urban Affairs Colition on the adoption side of the grant”Ashley Del Bianco: “It’s two grants used for providing broadband technology opportunities to Philadelphia and they’re mostly focused on access and adoption.”On the computer centers: “It’s a workforce issue,” said Andrew Buss, director of public programs for the City of Philadelphia’s Division of Technology.  “If we don’t have a trained, skilled workforce it will be difficult to attract employers to Philadelphia.”Buss, along with Lindsey Keck, the program manager for the Public Computer Center Project, helped the City coordinate with a dozen partner community organizations to launch computer centers all over Philadelphia. These centers will offer public access to computers, the Internet and computer skills training.http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/10/11/freedom-rings-partnership-what-it-is-and-how-public-private-partnerships-fuel-its-success-videoSome starter Q’sDescribe the FRP and what it means for PhillyHow has the rollout gone so far?

Tons of good info:http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/02/03/saskia-thompson-im-not-a-data-geek-im-a-city-geek-says-city-of-philadelphia-property-data-chief-qaArticle SummaryHer job is to square a dozen or more efforts and uses and agencies that track and rely on city address details — think permits from L&I and billing from utilities. The problem is that through the years, different city departments created their own processes and technologies, so whenever the U.S. Census comes around or the city wants to update its property tax assessments, there is a giant headache.Oh, and then there is the ongoing issue of how many vacant properties are in the City of Philadelphia.Was no owner for property data, so this team was formed.Housed in the Finance Department, which is also charged with the boondoggle of property tax assessment, Thompson first brought on a small additional staff last October and may do more. To do this right, she says, it will be another year before implementation of a solution begins.What is success for the project?It will have named data stewards for each piece of data and a clear process for tracking and maintaining changes. Secondly,] the ultimate success is that we know our data is trustworthy, transparent, easily accessible and it’s very customer friendly. I am a huge fan that government should be transparent and our data should be public, but we need to be on the forefront of doing that. The reason we’re not is not because we don’t want to share, it’s because we want to make sure what we share is accurate and want to do so in a responsible way.TimelineSo I expect to spend about six months doing the research phase and then a three to six months phase to design our solution.Now, if we find some low hanging fruit that is more easily fixable, we aren’t going to wait to do that, but I’m not going to set a timeline for implementation until we’ve really done our homework.Vacant PropertyThere are multiple efforts on vacant property because people are trying to tackle different things. The city has a role in managing vacant property, but we’re also not the only player when it’s a property we don’t own. There are multiple efforts that are probably related, but we are not leading them, though we will be part of them.Think of all the attributes that touch a piece of property.There’s the address, some cases there are multiple addresses. Our addresses don’t necessarily match Postal Service addresses, and they don’t necessarily need to. We use addresses for different reasons. We need to know where services are delivered, we need to know where it’s located, like street information and block ranges.Think of all the things that touch property history, ownership, zoning and things like we want to be able to have a history of an address and have all outstanding permits that have been assigned to that address.Our permit database — and we have one, we know what permits are assigned to an address – - but there’s no way to easily coordinate that, like how 911 routes police and fire or medic to an address. They are coming from completely different data tables.DataOne of the things that we don’t have is a consistent process for releasing any kind of data. I’d love to see that done. There’s a more seamless way to get information from the city.When I say there are other efforts going on, [the city is] trying to completely revamp our web process behind the scenes and our presence to the public, so how data becomes public is a part of many goals that are important.PersonalI’m not involved in this because of the data. I’m involved in this because I believe in making government as efficient as we can and moving it into at least the 20th century.And so I come at it from that perspective. I want the city to be more responsive because I think they’re great places to live. Every city has its own culture and its own unique vibe and that’s how I got involved in it.I’m not a data geek, I’m a city geek. I want to make the city work better.BioSaskia Thompson is a Deputy Finance Director with the City of Philadelphia, and serves as the Executive Director of the Office of Property Data. The Office of Property Data (OPD) is a newly created function intended to pull several disparate systems containing property-based information into one cohesive program. Once fully established, the OPD will act as the central point for all facets of property data and will ensure that all business processes related to the development and maintenance of property data are efficient, effective and customer-service focused. Ms. Thompson started with the City of Philadelphia in February 2011.From 2002 to 2011, Ms. Thompson worked for the City of Charlotte, North Carolina. As a member of the City Manager’s leadership staff, she was charged with resolving City Council issues, focusing organizational resources toward the resolution of neighborhood concerns, developing and implementing strategies to improving citizen’s access to city government, and supervising council staff. She also ran citywide customer service initiatives and in this capacity led the 311 effort for the City and County. As project manager and sponsor Ms. Thompson was responsible for all aspects of implementation including process design, site selection, organizational restructuring, and staff allocations, and supervised the 311 Call Center Director. Prior to working in the Charlotte City Manager’s Office, Ms. Thompson was the Assistant to the Mayor for Public Policy for the City of Detroit. She was an appointed member of Mayor Archer’s executive staff working on downtown development initiatives, transportation policy, technology, and improving city systems.QuestionsUpdate on status of projectsWhat’s the story with vacant property?

Our largest Digital Inclusion initiative, The Freedom Rings Partnership, is a collaborative consortium of nonprofits, universities, and City agencies working to provide physical infrastructure so that citizens can access technology, but also develop content and training programs so that citizens can adopt technology.The Freedom Rings Partnership is led by the City of Philadelphia and the Urban Affairs Coalition. Through its Public Computing Center and Sustainable Broadband Adoption grant initiatives, the Freedom Rings Partnership will:reach over 100,000 Philadelphians with information about the importance of broadband to their daily livesprovide free Internet access at 77 Public Computer Centers throughout the Citydeliver hands-on training to over 15,000 peopleFreedom Rings Partnership Access - Excite Center, I Work in PhillyThirty of the seventy-seven planned Public Computer Center sites are now operating throughout the city. So far the Freedom Rings Partnership has "graduated" 115 students through a PHA training program. These graduates earned a Netbook after completing an 8 hour training program. In total, 5,000 PHA residents will be eligible for earned Netbooks.Freedom Rings Partnership AdoptionSo far the Freedom Rings Partnership has delivered 120,823 hours of training to 7,399 participants across many training locations in Philadelphia neighborhoods. In addition, the plan is to attract at least 5,000 new subscribers to the Internet. Many of these subscribers are likely to be signed up through the new Comcast Internet Essentials program.Infotec Biz GrowthEconomic Development in the Infotec space: Removing roadblocks, providing incentives, and supporting the IT producing/using sectors to increase employment, revenue, productivity, prominence, and innovation.A 2008 Chamber of Commerce study found Infotec to be 8.5 % of the local economy.

Areas of improvement for this year.Talk about areas of focus for CfA - What are the kind of projects where she thinks we’d be most impactful? Where does she see CfA fitting into the full set of projects they’re funding here in Philly? Eg it’s related to X in this way...How could our work this year take advantage of other Knight funded work that’s happening? (Knight is keen on projects capitalizing on other projects)Run by her some of the things we’ve heard:Public safety: A tool that would allow any citizen with a cell phone to report a crime (engaged communities)Citizen feedback: A tool that would allow any citizen with a cell phone to provide answers to a set of questions, ie city wants to know what you think about the city plan (engaged communities)Public Art API and building a tool to show it (fostering the arts)With Jeff, run by her the idea about using Drexel co-op program to be stewards of the CBU platform. WAIT to see what Jeff’s new idea is.BackgroundJoined Knight Foundation in 2010 as Program Director for PhiladelphiaPreviously she launched and led the Philadelphia school district’s Office of College and Career Awareness. Prior to that, she helped to create the country's first online voter registration drive as executive director of Rock the Vote, Los Angeles.

After all, we're talking violence threatening tourism, business, the arts, the very heart of the city's livelihood.  But when the shooting of two black rowhouse residents in Port Richmond over the weekend - one was seven months pregnant - barely elicits attention, you have to wonder.”Philadelphia Teen Mobs: Why Aren’t Young People Being Included in the Conversation?OutlineIntros -- include that we are hearing mayor’s focus on public safetyWhat are the biggest stressors for you & your department?What makes people feel safe? Is there a difference between that and actually being safer? How do you balance the two?Can you help us put flash mobs in context of citywide safety? Is the attention it’s getting proportionate to impact? Expect that to come back this summer?We’re hearing and seeing that Penn put a lot of energy into neighborhood safety in West Philly, most visibly bike cops on nearly every corner. How did that experience work, would similar approaches be relevant across Philadelphia?[a]liz:Did this launch?
