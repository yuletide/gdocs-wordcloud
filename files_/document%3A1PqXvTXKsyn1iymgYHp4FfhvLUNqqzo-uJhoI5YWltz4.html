To do this right, she says, it will be another year before implementation of a solution begins.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.wousw92vpl7n"></a><span>What is success for the project?</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It will have named data stewards for each piece of data and a clear process for tracking and maintaining changes. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Secondly,] the ultimate success is that we know our data is trustworthy, transparent, easily accessible and it&rsquo;s very customer friendly. I am a huge fan that government should be transparent and our data should be public, but we need to be on the forefront of doing that. The reason we&rsquo;re not is not because we don&rsquo;t want to share, it&rsquo;s because we want to make sure what we share is accurate and want to do so in a responsible way.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.vcr4x0bes7mk"></a><span>Timeline</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So I expect to spend about six months doing the research phase and then a three to six months phase to design our solution.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Now, if we find some low hanging fruit that is more easily fixable, we aren&rsquo;t going to wait to do that, but I&rsquo;m not going to set a timeline for implementation until we&rsquo;ve really done our homework.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span></span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.iya4o66welh8"></a><span>Vacant Property</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There are multiple efforts on vacant property because people are trying to tackle different things. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The city has a role in managing vacant property, but we&rsquo;re also not the only player when it&rsquo;s a property we don&rsquo;t own. There are multiple efforts that are probably related, but we are not leading them, though we will be part of them.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Think of all the attributes that touch a piece of property.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">There&rsquo;s the address, some cases there are multiple addresses. Our addresses don&rsquo;t necessarily match Postal Service addresses, and they don&rsquo;t necessarily need to. We use addresses for different reasons. We need to know where services are delivered, we need to know where it&rsquo;s located, like street information and block ranges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Think of all the things that touch property history, ownership, zoning and things like we want to be able to have a history of an address and have all outstanding permits that have been assigned to that address.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Our permit database &mdash; and we have one, we know what permits are assigned to an address &ndash; - but there&rsquo;s no way to easily coordinate that, like how 911 routes police and fire or medic to an address. They are coming from completely different data tables.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.739wal5uqq5t"></a><span>Data</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">One of the things that we don&rsquo;t have is a consistent process for releasing any kind of data. I&rsquo;d love to see that done. There&rsquo;s a more seamless way to get information from the city.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When I say there are other efforts going on, [the city is] trying to completely revamp our web process behind the scenes and our </span><span class="c5"><a class="c1" href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2011/11/11/phila-govbusiness-launches-phase-two-featuring-business-assistant-wizard">presence to the public</a></span><span class="c2">, so how data becomes public is a part of many goals that are important.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h3 class="c0"><a name="h.xuizgdhu3yj8"></a><span>Personal</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m not involved in this because of the data. I&rsquo;m involved in this because I believe in making government as efficient as we can and moving it into at least the 20th century.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And so I come at it from that perspective. I want the city to be more responsive because I think they&rsquo;re great places to live. Every city has its own culture and its own unique vibe and that&rsquo;s how I got involved in it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I&rsquo;m not a data geek, I&rsquo;m a city geek.

The Office of Property Data (OPD) is a newly created function intended to pull several disparate systems containing property-based information into one cohesive program. Once fully established, the OPD will act as the central point for all facets of property data and will ensure that all business processes related to the development and maintenance of property data are efficient, effective and customer-service focused. Ms. Thompson started with the City of Philadelphia in February 2011.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">From 2002 to 2011, Ms. Thompson worked for the City of Charlotte, North Carolina.
