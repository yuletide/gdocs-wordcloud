Best to not rely on this method. Relying on unpaid goodwill from developers will only last for so long before enthusiasm dies out, best not to rely on this. Motivation: Well-intentioned coders will only last so long. To maintain the instance requires payment or &ldquo;a masochistic streak&rdquo;. Common problem in open source (and other) projects, a la &ldquo;a theater&rdquo; is maintenance. Building it is not the hard part.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idea: </span><span>Each city pays into a fund, LP acts as PM to coordinate features across cities (hosting is worked out on a city-by-city basis). Trade money for expertise &amp; coding. Funding would be around 10-15k per city as part of a consortium, depending on how many cities pay in.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idea: </span><span>Ad-space in the sidebar from local partners in exchange for dev and hosting and promotion</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Idea</span><span>: Get an academic institution to become the technical sponsor. Discussed option of having Drexel co-op students take it over. They would manage it for 6-months, then pass it off to the next set of co-op students, and so on. CfA would serve as ongoing mentor/guidance.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>To set this up, CfA would work to establish a set of best practices that we&rsquo;d &ldquo;train&rdquo; the next set of co-op students on (starting in April).
