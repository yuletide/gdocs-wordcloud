Airy&rsquo;s commercial corridor, Germantown Avenue, suffered because of nearby blight. Abandoned property reduced the value of surrounding homes and created cover for criminal activity.</span></li><li class="c0 c11"><span class="c8">The success of Phebe Commons, a retail and office complex located at 6700 Germantown Avenue, shows how a neighborhood can turn itself around.</span></li><li class="c0 c11"><span class="c8">Eventually, Mt. Airy USA acquired the property, but it was not easy. &quot;Vacant land owners know you&rsquo;ll pay a premium to get them out of Dodge,&quot; Jimenez remarked.</span></li></ol><ol class="c4" start="1"><li class="c0 c11"><span class="c8">Over the next two years, the nonprofit worked diligently to acquire surrounding lots, some owned by the city.
